# Dynamic Color Boxes & Live Header Text

Experience an engaging web interaction where colors transform and titles evolve with a click. This project showcases clean and efficient DOM manipulation in JavaScript, bringing static elements to life.

## Features

- Click any box to change its color intelligently.
- Header text updates smoothly via dedicated JavaScript functions.
- Lightweight, intuitive UI with real-time responsiveness.
- Ideal for beginners to explore DOM events and dynamic styling.

## How It Works

The core JavaScript listens for click events on each box, triggering a function that shifts its background color. Simultaneously, another function modifies the header's text content based on user interactions, making the page feel alive and interactive.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML5 & CSS3 for layout and styling
- DOM API for dynamic content updates

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and open `index.html` in any modern browser to see the magic unfold. Customize the color palette or header messages to make it your own!

## Why This Project?

This is more than a simple color changer; it's a practical exercise in mastering JavaScript's DOM capabilities, event-driven programming, and crafting responsive user experiences.
